**Movie Project**

Our assignment was to develop a movie list website that allowed the average user to browse through movies and even search a movie by name. This site was also to allow administrative users to add, edit and delete movies from the movie list as well as add, edit and delete genres. Any string or integer input is stored in a Postgresql database while pictures uploaded when adding a movie were stored in a file within the project itself.
